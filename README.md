* **this project will create a basic program that will help you manage a collection of items that needs to be organized 
  and managed. Here we create a program that will help you manage a collection of recipes.**

* **This program will contain three classes.**
* **1** **One for main recipe items.**
* **2** **one for the ingredients that are part of the recipe.**
* **3** **One for the entire collection of recipes.**

* **Ingredient class will model the items that will be stored in each recipe
    in your collection. It will have soe basic attributes (of numeric or string types)
     and soe basic methods.**
* **Recipe class will start off similar to Ingredient class, but it will increase its functionality by modifying it to 
     accept the ingredient objects, containing all the details stored in an Ingredient class object. We will expand the 
     Recipe class by adding recipe-specific methods to the Recipe class.**
* **The application driver class will allow the user to create a new recipe and add it to the collection In addition, 
    it will allow the user to see a list of item in the collection and then give the user an option to either see more 
    information about a particular item(by retrieving it from the collection) or edit an item that is already in the 
    collection. the program will also allow the user to delete an item from the collection.**
